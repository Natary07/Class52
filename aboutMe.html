        <h3>Hello, my name is Aryan Patel. I am born on April 1, 2007 in Ontario, Canada, but I have spent most of my life in USA.<br>
             I came to USA at 3 years old and started Pre-K in America. I went to Universal Academy until 5th grade. The school I <br>
             went to was amazing and it helped me set my foundation for middle school and high school.
